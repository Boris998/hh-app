üö® Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. TypeScript Errors in Zod Schemas

Make sure you're using the function syntax: (schema) => schema.min(3)
Update drizzle-zod to latest version if needed

2. Migration Errors

Check DATABASE_URL is correctly set
Ensure PostgreSQL is running
Verify user has CREATE permissions

3. Seeding Fails

Check activity-types.seed.ts has all required data
Verify JSON schema validation passes
Ensure no duplicate activity names

4. API Endpoints Return 500

Check server logs for detailed errors
Verify database connection
Ensure all imports are correct

Quick Fixes
bash# Reset and re-setup database
pnpm db:push --force
pnpm seed:activity-types

# Check database connection
pnpm db:studio

# View detailed logs
pnpm start # Check console output
üîÑ Next Steps
After implementing ActivityTypes, you can:

Update Activity Creation - Modify activity forms to select from ActivityTypes
Add Skill Definitions - Implement the full skill rating system
Build ELO Engine - Use the ELO settings for calculations
Create Activity Matching - Suggest activities based on user ELO/skills
Add Activity Analytics - Track popular activity types and participation

üìù Migration Notes
If you have existing activities:

The migration adds activity_type_id_new column first
Manually map existing activities to new ActivityTypes
Then enable the foreign key constraint
Finally, drop the old activityTypeId column

This prevents data loss during the transition.
